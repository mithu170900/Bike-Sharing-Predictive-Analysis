# Predictive Analysis on Bike Sharing Registrations
Bike sharing has become popular in major cities around the world due to its convenience and positive effect on the
environment. The present study aims to build a prediction model for volume of future bike rentals based on the investigation
of key factors that influenced this outcome in 2011 and 2012. The data were collected on a daily basis along with climate
information such as temperature, weather, season, day of the week, humidity, wind speed. We fit four multiple linear
regression models using temperature, weather, and season as predictors and total number of bike rentals for casual weekday
users, registered weekday users, casual weekend users, and registered weekend users as our four outcomes. Our models
predicted bike rentals in 2012 relatively well though with room for improvement.
